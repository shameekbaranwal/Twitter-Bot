# Twitter-Bot

This project contains five progressing versions of a twitter bot I made while practicing Node.js.
It works with the official Twitter API by using the Twit module.

## Bot #1 - Random Number Generator
This bot tweets a random number every ten seconds.

## Bot #2 - Retweets When Tagged
This bot, whenever mentioned in a tweet, will retweet that tweet.

## Bot #3 - Replies With An Insult
This bot, whenever mentioned in a tweet, will access the Insults API available [here](https://insults.tr00st.co.uk) and reply to the tweet with the fetched insult. 

## Bot #4 - Replies With A Shakespearean Insult
This bot, whenever mentioned in a tweet, will generate a random insult using victorian nouns and reply to that tweet with it.

## Bot #5 - Replies With A Roast
This bot, whenever mentioned in a tweet, will access the Roasts API available [here](https://evilinsult.com/) and reply to the tweet with the fetched roast.
